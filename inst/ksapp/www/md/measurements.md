# Measurements
Eighteen measurements were collected from the six long bones from each image with custom software designed for Lodox (Diagnostic Viewing Software). Length and breadth measurement definitions were modified from fetal osteology or from adult postcranial standard measurements (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978; Moore-Jansen et al., 1994). 
<br><br>
Written definitions are provided below. Pay attention to the *‘Comment’* as this usually provides some insight to landmark location placement. Unlike cranial landmarks, none of the measurements are Type I. Measurements should be collected only when the bone is in anatomical position. If measurements are being collected from radiographic images, ensure it is an imaging technique that does not generate significant levels of distortion.

#### Humerus diaphyseal length (HDL)
The maximum distance between the most proximal edge of the diaphysis to the most distal edge of the diaphysis (modified from Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).
<br>
*__Comment:__ The most distal portion is generally the medial portion.*
<br><br>

#### Humerus proximal breadth (HPB)
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the proximal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the element is in anatomical position.
<br>
*__Comment:__ This is not a maximum breadth.*
<br><br>

#### Humerus distal breadth (HDB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral points on the distal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the element is in anatomical position (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978). 
<br><br>

#### Humerus midshaft breadth (HMSB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges at midshaft, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).
<br>
*__Comment:__ Determine midshaft when obtaining diaphyseal length. Note, this is not a minimum or maximum.*

#### Ulna diaphyseal length (UDL) 
The maximum distance between the most proximal edge of the diaphysis to the most distal edge of the diaphysis (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978). 
<br><br>

#### Ulna midshaft breadth (UMSB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges at midshaft, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).

<br><br>

#### Radius proximal breadth (RPB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the proximal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (modified from Urcid, 1992). 
<br><br>

#### Radius distal breadth (RDB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the distal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position.
<br>
*__Comment:__ The measurement is obtained from the anterior projections on the distal diaphysis.*
<br><br>

#### Radius midshaft breadth (RMSB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges at midshaft, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (modified from Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).
<br>
*__Comment:__ Determine midshaft when obtaining diaphyseal length. Note, this is not a minimum or maximum.*

#### Femur diaphyseal length (FDL) 
The maximum distance between the most proximal edge of the diaphysis to the most distal edge of the diaphysis (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978). Comment: The most distal point is generally the medial projection on the metaphysis. The expression is slight in infants but becomes more pronounced as age increases. 
<br><br>

#### Femur distal breadth (FDB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the distal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (modified from Fazekas and Kósa, 1978). 
<br><br>

#### Femur midshaft breadth (FMSB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges at midshaft, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).
<br>
*__Comment:__ Determine midshaft when obtaining diaphyseal length. Note, this is not a minimum or maximum.*

#### Tibia diaphyseal length (TDL) 
The maximum distance between the most proximal edge of the diaphysis to the most distal edge of the diaphysis (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978). Comment: Generally, the most proximal point is medial and the most distal point is lateral. 
<br><br>

#### Tibia proximal breadth (TPB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the proximal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (modified from Moore-Jansen et al., 1994). 
<br><br>

#### Tibia distal breadth (TDB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges of the distal diaphysis, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone in anatomical position (modified from Moore-Jansen et al., 1994).
<br>
*__Comment:__ The lateral edge is the anterior projection of the fibular notch.*
<br><br>

#### Tibia midshaft breadth (TMSB) 
The distance between the most medial and lateral edges at midshaft, perpendicular to the long axis of the bone, when the bone is in anatomical position (Fazekas and Kósa, 1978).
