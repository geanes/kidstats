# Overview
__Kidstats__ permits the application of robust multivariate statistical analyses to produce subadult age and sex estimations with 95% prediction intervals. The only reference sample that is currently available for model creation is from South Africa (n = 1380). The subadults are between the ages of birth and 12 years and include individuals from the three largest South African social races. 
<br><br>
The even age distribution (minus a few smaller sample sizes at the two youngest age categories and the oldest age category) and large sample ensures the skeletal variation in the South African population is adequately captured at all ages.

Future intentions include the incorporation of additional populations so there are numerous reference samples. If there is data available that has measurements comparable to the descriptions in the __Measurements__ section, please contact __Kyra Stull PhD__ to discuss incorporating the samples into the program.
